# What is Tdarr?

Tdarr is a popular conditional transcoding application for processing large (or small) media libraries. The application comes in the form of a click-to-run web-app, which you run on your own device and access through a web browser.

Tdarr uses two popular transcoding applications under the hood: FFmpeg and HandBrake (which itself is built on top of FFmpeg).

Terms:
```
Transcoding: digital to digital media conversion

Conditional: Each file is run through a set of customisable rules to determine 
             whether it needs to be transcoded or not
```
