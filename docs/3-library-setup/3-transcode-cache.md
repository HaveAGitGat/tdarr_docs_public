# Transcode Cache

Must set. Files will be transcoded into the transcode cache folder and then copied back into your source library, replacing the original file. It may be beneficial to set the transcode cache on a different disk drive.

:::tip
It's recommended to use a cheap SSD for the transcode cache.
